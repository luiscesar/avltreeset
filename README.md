"# avltreeset" 

Abstract Data Type Ordered Set (set with a total order relationship <):

        Lookup (contains), Insert (+), Delete (-)


Implemented with AVL Tree.

Where lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. 

Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
